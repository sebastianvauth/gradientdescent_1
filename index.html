        <h1>Welcome to the World of Optimization!</h1>
        <p>Hello there, future machine learning masters! Have you ever wondered how a machine learning model goes from being a confused mess to making accurate predictions? It's not magic, it's <strong>optimization</strong>! In this course, we're going to unravel the secrets behind one of the most important algorithms in machine learning: <strong>Gradient Descent</strong>. But first, let us start why we even need it in the first place.</p>

    <section id="section2">
        <p>Imagine you're trying to bake the perfect cake. You have a recipe, but you're not quite sure about the exact amount of sugar or the perfect baking time. So, you bake a cake, taste it, and adjust the ingredients. You repeat this process until you have the most delicious cake ever. That's optimization in a nutshell! You are iteratively trying to find the best combination for your model.</p>
        <div class="continue-button" onclick="showNextSection(3)">Continue</div>
    </section>

    <section id="section3">
        <p>In machine learning, optimization is similar. We have a model, which is like our cake recipe. The model has parameters, which are like the ingredients. Our goal is to find the best values for these parameters so that our model makes the best possible predictions. Instead of a cake we have a dataset and instead of taste we have a cost function to evaluate how good our 'ingredients' are.</p>
        <div class="continue-button" onclick="showNextSection(4)">Continue</div>
    </section>

    <section id="section4">
        <p>We start with some initial values for the parameters, make a prediction, evaluate how good that prediction is, and then adjust the parameters to improve the prediction. We repeat this until we have a model that performs well. The method of adjusting the parameters is our optimization algorithm.</p>

    <section id="section5">
        <p>One common way to find the 'best' parameters for a model is the <strong>Least Squares</strong> method. The idea is simple: we want to find the parameters that minimize the difference between what our model predicts and what we actually observe in our data.</p>

        <p>Think of it like trying to draw a line that best fits a set of points on a graph. You want the line to be as close as possible to all the points. Least squares helps us find the equation of that line by minimizing the sum of the squared distances between the points and the line.</p>

    <section id="section7">
        <p>Mathematically, if our model's prediction is given by \( f(x) \) and the actual value is \( y \), we want to minimize the sum of squared errors: \( \sum (y - f(x))^2 \). For simple linear regression (where \( f(x) = mx + b \), there's a direct formula to find the best \( m \) (slope) and \( b \) (intercept) that minimize this sum.</p>
        <p>Let's break down the math behind least squares for a simple linear regression. Our goal is to find the slope \( m \) and y-intercept \( b \) of the line \( y = mx + b \) that best fits our data.</p>
        <p>Given a set of \( n \) data points \( (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n) \), we want to minimize the sum of the squared differences between the actual \( y \) values and the predicted \( y \) values. This sum is called the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS):</p>
        <p>\[ RSS(m, b) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (mx_i + b))^2 \]</p>
        <p>To find the minimum of this function, we take the partial derivatives with respect to \( m \) and \( b \), set them equal to zero, and solve for \( m \) and \( b \).</p>
        <h4>Partial Derivative with respect to \( m \)</h4>
        <p>\[ \frac{\partial RSS}{\partial m} = -2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i(y_i - (mx_i + b)) \]</p>
        <p>Setting this to zero gives us:</p>
        <p>\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i(y_i - (mx_i + b)) = 0 \]</p>
        <h4>Partial Derivative with respect to \( b \)</h4>
        <p>\[ \frac{\partial RSS}{\partial b} = -2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (mx_i + b)) \]</p>
        <p>Setting this to zero gives us:</p>
        <p>\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (mx_i + b)) = 0 \]</p>
        <h4>Solving for \( m \) and \( b \)</h4>
        <p>Solving these two equations simultaneously gives us the formulas for \( m \) and \( b \):</p>
        <p>\[ m = \frac{n\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_iy_i - \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i}{n\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2 - (\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i)^2} \]</p>
        <p>\[ b = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i - m\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i}{n} \]</p>
        <h4>Example Calculation</h4>
        <p>Let's say we have the following data points: (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 5)</p>
        <p>First, we calculate the sums:</p>
        <p>\[ \sum x_i = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \]</p>
        <p>\[ \sum y_i = 2 + 4 + 5 = 11 \]</p>
        <p>\[ \sum x_iy_i = 1*2 + 2*4 + 3*5 = 25 \]</p>
        <p>\[ \sum x_i^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 14 \]</p>
        <p>Then, we plug these into the formulas for \( m \) and \( b \):</p>
        <p>\[ m = \frac{3*25 - 6*11}{3*14 - 6^2} = \frac{75 - 66}{42 - 36} = \frac{9}{6} = 1.5 \]</p>
        <p>\[ b = \frac{11 - 1.5*6}{3} = \frac{11 - 9}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \]</p>
        <p>So, the line of best fit is \( y = 1.5x + 0.67 \).</p>

    <section id="section8">
        <p>Sounds great, right? We have a method to find the perfect parameters! But there's a catch. The direct formulas for least squares become computationally very expensive (or even impossible to compute) when we have a lot of data or when our model has many parameters.</p>
        <div class="why-it-matters">
            <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
            <p>In today's world, we often deal with massive datasets and complex models with millions or even billions of parameters. Least squares simply can't handle that scale efficiently.</p>

    <section id="section9">
        <p>Imagine trying to fit a line to millions of data points. The calculations would take forever! And that's just a simple line. More complex models, like neural networks, have many more parameters, making least squares impractical.</p>

    <section id="section10">

    </section>

    <section id="section11">
        <p>This is where <strong>Gradient Descent</strong> comes to the rescue! Instead of trying to calculate the perfect parameters directly, gradient descent takes an iterative approach. It starts with an initial guess for the parameters and gradually improves them step-by-step, like a hiker finding their way down a mountain by following the steepest path.</p>

    <section id="section12">
        <p>The 'gradient' in gradient descent refers to the slope of the cost function (which measures how bad our model's predictions are) with respect to the parameters. By moving in the opposite direction of the gradient (downhill), we can iteratively reduce the cost and improve our model.</p>
